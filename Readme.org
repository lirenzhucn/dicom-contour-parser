* Parser design

** Testing contour to binary mask conversion
   See tests/test_parsing.py test_poly_to_mask function. Briefly, the test will
   check if all True pixels are inside the polygon. The inside check is done by
   matplotlib.path module. Caveat: due to boundary issues, checking all False
   pixels are not feasible right now; therefore, this test is not comprehensive.
